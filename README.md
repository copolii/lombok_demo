# Lombok Demo

This repository contains the source code for my Lombok introduction, which is the 1st installment of my [_Code Mode Efficiently Series_](https://mahram.ca/code-more-efficiently/ "Code Mode Efficiently")

The slides can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kR345Aet2Atm-lr4yazpTHq7VtJ5TqU-x1JocvrfFSA "Lombok Demo")

I've also written [a blog post](https://mahram.ca/cme-lombok/ "Lombok: Spice up your Java") to accompany the slides.

To run the demo, run the './gradlew test' on Mac/Linux and 'gradlew.bat test' on Windows machines. If you don't want to use Gradle, you'll need [lombok.jar] (http://projectlombok.org/downloads/lombok.jar "Download Lombok") to build the code.

Comments and feedback are always welcome.
