# Lombok Demo

WORK IN PROGRESS. NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

This repository contains the source code for my Lombok demo talk.
The slides can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kR345Aet2Atm-lr4yazpTHq7VtJ5TqU-x1JocvrfFSA "Lombok Demo") 
You'll need [lombok.jar] (http://projectlombok.org/downloads/lombok.jar "Download Lombok") to build the code.
